# Basic Python
Every Boilermaker Engineer Codes Entry Level Programming

Course Description:
Students are introduced to the concepts and practices of programming using Python.
The programming techniques to be introduced are applicable to all other computer languages. Examples with engineering applications will be adopted to illustrate the programming concepts. Students will learn the syntax, algorithms, and development tools used to document/implement computer logic. They will practice structured programming concepts such as variables, making decisions, looping, containers (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets), file handling and applications, and modularization techniques. They will also be introduced to the basic objectoriented programming concepts such as class and object, data attributes, methods, constructors, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
